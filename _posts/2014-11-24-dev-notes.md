As for all our work, we try to follow the coding standards and naming rules most commonly in use:

-   the [PEAR coding standards](http://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.php)
-   the [PHP Framework Interoperability Group standards](http://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards).

Knowing that, all classes are named and organized in an architecture to allow the use of the
[standard SplClassLoader](http://gist.github.com/jwage/221634).

The whole package is embedded in the `AssetsManager` namespace.

To install all PHP packages for development, just run:

    composer install --dev

A development documentation can be generated with [Sami](http://github.com/fabpot/Sami) running:

    php vendor/sami/sami/sami.php render sami.config.php

The latest version of this development documentation is available online at <http://assetsmanager.ateliers-pierrot.fr/phpdoc/>.

[**Les Ateliers Pierrot**](http://www.ateliers-pierrot.fr/) is a small house-made workshop for web developments from Paris, France.
We build & manage open source packages to help making the world a sexy place ... Our favorite programing language is PHP, 
we only work under *NIX systems and we usually integrate other great open source projects.

*Les Ateliers Pierrot* are founded by *Pierre Cassat* (aka. [@piwi](http://e-piwi.fr/)).

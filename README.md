Assets Manager
==============

A [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) plugin to manage `***-assets` package type.


## How does it work?

The goal of this [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) plugin is to **manage the assets files of a package**
(javascript libraries, CSS stylesheets or views) just like Composer manages PHP sources.
Assets files are downloaded and stored in a specific `vendor` directory and an internal
system permits to retrieve and load assets just like PHP classes (a kind of *assets autoloader*).
Some **presets** can be defined in package's configuration to construct a full set of assets files
grouped by type, library or usage.

Just like any standard Composer feature, all names or configuration variables are configurable.
